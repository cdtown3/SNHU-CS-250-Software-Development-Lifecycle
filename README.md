# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Having open communication with the client is essential for agile, and for creating user stories. User stories are a way for developers and testers to understand the various needs of the client. User stories are also much more dynamic than a requirements form. Static requirements are unrealistic when working on these projects and teams should expect change. The consistent format of user stories also help when working on prioritizing the tasks needed for each sprint.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I'd love to incorporate all of the agile processes I've learned in this course. If I had to pick specific processes they would be:
  - Accepting failure as a part of success
  - Expecting change during the development process
  - Creating user stories and a product backlog for prioritization and organization
  - Working in short sprints to provide deliverables for testing and presentation purposes

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member is able to admit when a mistake has been made and learn from it. They aren't too prideful to ask for help, and accept help when it is offered. The team member is able to give criticism in a helpful and mature way, and they can also receive criticism without taking it to heart.
